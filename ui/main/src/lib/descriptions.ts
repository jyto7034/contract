    `We are combining NFTs with Tokens to create a new EGGsperience in trading your beloved NFTs. <br>
            Our chicken NFT will always be interchangeable with our $EGG token in a ratio of 1:800,000.`,

    `Benefits of our hybrid model: <br>
            &nbsp;1. Deflationary NFT: As more unique holders of $EGG onboard, fewer holders will be able to swap<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; back to the Chicken NFT, creating a supply crunch and increasing value.`,

    `&nbsp;2. Two-Way-Liquidity: We solve the whale-slippage problem with 0% royalties on our NFT. If you want to <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            sell a significant amount of your $EGG, simply swap to the Chicken NFT and sell it on the NFT <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            marketplace. Zero-Slippage-Zero-Trust-OTC just hybrid DEFI things!`,

    `&nbsp;3. Fractional Ownership of NFT: Want fractional exposure to chickegg? Just buy some $EGG tokens, and <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            you will benefit from the ups! Arbitrage Opportunities: As NFTs and Tokens are traded on separate <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            markets, creating opportunities for premiums on one side. This is perfect for traders. Traders can swap<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            to the NFT or Token wherever the premium is and get extra SEI by trading!`,

    `&nbsp;4. More to Come: We are not only building and delivering the HYBRID meta to SEI but also developing the <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            meta further by introducing new mechanisms that will enhance the HYBRID model. Stay tuned for more<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            updates!`
